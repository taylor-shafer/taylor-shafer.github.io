			<b>EVEN STARS GET HUNGRY</b><br><br>Taylor S. Shafer<br><br><br>No one wanted to eat the bug-man. Cricket never knew he was considered so disgusting until the ship wrecked in deep space and the crew polished off the last of the galley stores. Even Private Lyleman, who routinely devoured insect protein on his home station, wouldn't consider it. The human insisted it just wasn't the same. You wouldn't say you're eating corn, he reasoned, when you eat syrup-sweetened biscuits. That did not make Cricket feel any better.<br><br>The bug-man crawled up the ladder from the communications deck to the crew quarters, careful not to catch his wings on any exposed wires. The radar circuits were repaired days ago, but he never found the energy to reseal the wall panels. After resting for a moment on the top rung, Cricket hefted himself up onto the filthy carpeting. The simple journey from one deck to another was draining. If he didn't know better, he would consider jamming the gravity spinners to make his rounds just a little bit easier. He did know better, however. The rest of the survivors felt ill enough without a sudden change in gravity. One indelicate move and his shipmates might grow too sick to turn the bug-man into a bug-corpse, edible or not.<br><br>Up in the common room, the remaining crewmen sat scowling as always. Huddled under blankets were Lyleman, two furry murkas named Blackhorn and Johnny, and the avian captain who probably hailed from Frillidill. It hardly mattered. Whichever worlds they came from, they were all warm-blooded, and on a wrecked ship, warm blood meant cold bodies.<br><br>“I'm concerned about your health,” Cricket said. His humming wings and clicking mandibles translated through a portable computer into more palatable sounds for his shipmates. “Everyone needs to eat.”<br><br>“No,” said the captain. A set of holodice was scattered at his feet. “Not yet. We need to hold out for rescue.”<br><br>Lyleman said, “I wish you could freeze with the rest of us.” The marine was curled up next to a vent as though he could snatch up trace amounts of heat from the pipes. Dark green blood still crusted around his lips. <br><br>“I can feel it well enough,” Cricket said. He tried not to look his shipmates in the eyes, so he raised his own toward the ceiling. The pipes were frosted over in white. Down on the engineering deck where they kept the bones, he knew the furnaces fared no better. Sometimes he wished they would spark back online so he could roast himself alive in penance for his failures. “Still, I am sorry about the cold.”<br><br>“You should tell that to Orchid,” Lyleman said. “It's one thing to wreck the ship during a merchant run, but when we're hauling passengers?”<br><br>“I am sorry. I know you have an attachment to the plant woman. I saw the tapes in your cabin.”<br><br>“You what?”<br><br>“I found them while scrubbing down your quarters. Behind the chocolate you used to have stowed away. I know Orchid must mean a lot to you.”<br><br>“Wish I had that chocolate now.”<br><br>“We would all feel better if we ate a little.”<br><br>“I am acutely aware of my hunger,” Blackhorn said. Johnny slept still and silent in her furry lap. His breathing was faint. “However, as the captain noted, we are on minimal rations for a rational reason.”<br><br>“If we try to save every life aboard, everyone may die. We cannot idle away our remaining energy. The ship must survive.”<br><br>“Oh, bug off and eat some vines,” Lyleman said. He turned toward the wall.<br><br>“I appreciate your concern, Cricket, but there is nothing we can do,” Blackhorn said. “You're the only one on the ship who can survive eating the vegetation in the growth tunnels, so you can do your part eating those.”<br><br>“I hate chewing on those roots.”<br><br>“We're all hungry. I can feel my ribcage.” Blackhorn rubbed her stomach under the sheets and glanced at the emaciated murka in her lap. “But look at Johnny. Until he eats, none of us eat.”<br><br>“Johnny appears to be passing already. If you're truly so hungry, perhaps it's time.”<br><br>“I'm not eating Johnny. That's the whole point of our... desperation plan. We don't have to be cannibals when most of our shipmates are of different species.”<br><br>“I don't want to think about it,” the captain said. <br><br>“I am only trying to be helpful,” Cricket continued. “To my detriment, my stomach can't digest anyone. Other than the plant woman.” He scurried across the room, looking out the portholes. A particularly bright star was shining that evening, though not bright enough to warm the ship. The bug-man's thoughts turned to another nearby star. Since Orchid was their passenger and onboard celebrity, her survival was the ship's priority. Of course, if she was doomed to die anyway... He shook the thought from his head. “Perhaps it is time to eat me. If I cannot eat, I am useless, so let me be useful.”<br><br>“We've been over this, Cricket,” the captain said. “We don't want to eat anyone, and we especially don't want to eat you. For all I know, bug-men are toxic.”<br><br>“For all you know, everyone here could be toxic to everyone else.”<br><br>“You're disgusting. Get over it.” Lyleman's voice was muffled by his blanket.<br><br>“So it all comes down to xenophobia.” Cricket rubbed his arms together into a chirp.<br><br>“Call it whatever you like,” the captain said. “Get to your watch, or whatever it is you're supposed to be doing.”<br><br>The bug-man was, in fact, supposed to be eating. He crept back to the ladders and slowly began to ascend. Even talking about normal food was preferable to filling his belly with vegetation from the growth tunnels, but he arrived in the crawlspace to gnaw at the thick, tough vines day after day anyway. He wasn't sure if hunger dragged him there or merely his sense of routine.<br><br>Inside the tunnels, he stumbled through the darkness until he felt the knob under his hand. He dialed up the lamps just a little. The solar circuit still had some battery power left, but it wouldn't last if he wasn't careful. At the current rate of consumption, the lamps would last almost five Earth months more. If he gave the plants all they hungered for, the batteries would be dead in three weeks.<br><br>Under normal circumstances, Cricket might feel sorry for the plants. The tunnels were as bright as a heavily overcast day, and it was all the roots could do to maintain their current strength. The vines never grew anymore, and sometimes the bug-man wondered if they weren't shrinking. In truth, Cricket couldn't muster up the strength to care. He had to eat the blasted things, and that was suffering enough. He knelt onto the mossy floor and started gnawing. <br><br>Behind him, someone else climbed into the tunnel. He ignored the sound and kept chewing the tasteless fiber, wondering if he was expelling more energy trying to eat than he gained swallowing. The new arrival would be Orchid, the plant woman. She was the only other person on the ship that wasn't dependent on butchery to survive. Since Orchid mostly fed on sunrays, they ate in the same shift.<br><br>“Hello, Cricket. I hope you're feeling better today.”<br><br>“Hello. Thank you. I am not.” Cricked turned away from his vine to watch the plant lady eat. He ogled her leafy greens as she exposed her body to the sun lamps. The leaves, which recently began to brown, perked up a little in the light.<br><br>“That's too bad,” she said, twirling to feed the leaves on her back. “We're all hungry.”<br><br>“I didn't know you could get hungry.” The bug-man chewed on the vine some more, all too aware of the conspicuous brown syrup that drooled from the side of his mouth.<br><br>“Maybe you wouldn't call it hunger, but we crave light and water and nutrients all the same, especially when we're not planted. I wasn't designed to move this much.”<br><br>“You misunderstand me. I thought celebrities are immune to such lowly concerns as hunger.” He thought that was how the joke went. He heard Lyleman tell it at dinner service back when the engines still worked.<br><br>She laughed, so far as plant people are able to laugh. “You're funny, Cricket. I don't usually get to talk to the astronauts on my flights.”<br><br>“I assume you don't often get stranded either.”<br><br>“No, I don't. How many shows have I missed, three? My people must be going crazy. Still, it's nice to talk.”<br><br>“Are you sure it's that nice? I never see you except at meal times. You spend so much time with the other crew.” The bug-man turned back to what technically counted as his food. Finally, a chunk of the vine softened just enough to swallow. It scratched down his gullet like a piece of petrified bark.<br><br>“That's not it at all. You have to understand, I can't be down by the engines or I might get sick. I talk to the others during the day, but I still see you more than any of them. I really do like spending time with you, Cricket.”<br><br>“That may be,” he said before starting at another length of vegetation. The tunnels fell silent, and he wondered if Orchid was looking at him. Before he could finish eating and turn around, however, footsteps rang up the ladder.<br><br>“All hands on deck,” the captain's voice yelled up into the tunnels. “An unidentified ship is heading our way. This could be it.”<br><br>Cricket was happy to oblige. He abandoned his half-chewed root and scrambled down the ladder. The star he noticed earlier was even brighter now. No, not brighter— closer. He glanced at his shipmates as they stared at the same white spot. The captain watched through his spyglass. The speck was no star, but a pale white ship in flight.<br><br>“Is it a rescue ship?” Orchid asked when she arrived. “They must have launched an expedition weeks ago.”<br><br>“Doubt it,” the captain said without lowering his eyes from the glass. “There were no attempts to hail, visual or otherwise.”<br><br>“Oh gods, they're pirates.”<br><br>“Not likely. You don’t just stumble across victims in deep space.”<br><br>The details of the ship grew visible at a painfully gradual pace. Cricket first saw the bone-white color of the ship, then the bones that accompanied the white. A great triangular skull ornamented the ship's nose while other skeletal jaws marked ports on its sides. Then came the antennae, thick and sprouting from the hull like whips of hair. The hull architecture was no more pleasant, twisting in ways that defied function. Despite being the first ship spotted in months, it was not a welcome sight.<br><br>And it was coming in fast.<br><br>“I... I think it's going to ram us,” Blackhorn said.<br><br>“Not at this trajectory,” the captain said with the most authoritative tone he had managed in months. “It's going to dock.”<br><br>Shadows of the bone ship's teeth striped their windows, and the skull swallowed them whole. The crew erupted into nervous murmuring as their ship settled into the shadowed maw. The captain let them talk for a moment before yelling over the chatter. “That will be enough. You can be as frightened as you like, but we have few options. I think we've landed in some kind of hangar. That means we can either continue rotting on this ship or send out a scouting party. And as we all know, there’s not much to be done sitting around the common room except throw the dice.”<br><br>Lyleman’s stomach growled.<br><br>“Send in Cricket,” Blackhorn said. “If he's so keen on dying, let him do it on another ship.” <br><br>“I may not be the optimal choice,” the bug-man buzzed. “I was trained as an engineer. I can do little as an ambassador or boarding marine.”<br><br>“That's exactly why you're going with the scouts,” the captain said. “If there's any equipment we could use out there, you're going to be the one to identify it.”<br><br>“As you wish, captain.”<br><br>“Lyleman, you're obviously going to lead the search, but don't take risks. You see anything unusual, you retreat. Got it?”<br><br>“I’m going too,” Orchid said.<br><br>“Excuse me, miss? You were the reason for this trip, and I intend to keep you alive even if the rest of us die.”<br><br>“If only I were that important,” Blackhorn said.<br><br>The plant woman was not so easily dissuaded. “You're bound by ship's law to keep me comfortable. I need to see what's out there. No one has ever seen a ship like this. Is there anyone on board better equipped to spread word of discovery than a genuine celebrity?”<br><br>“You plan to sing about this thing?” the captain asked.<br><br>“Maybe, maybe not. Either way, I'm curious, and you'll either have to let me see or forcibly restrain me.”<br><br>The avian sighed and shook his head. “I'm too tired to argue. I can't stop you, but know that I do not sanction your suicide. Private Lyleman, outfit the search party and keep in contact.”<br><br>Lyleman was eager to gear up and looked a proper knight with his infantry armor and combat rifle. Cricket, on the other hand, was a bad parody of the soldier. He was outfitted in an undersized security harness that pinched at his carapace and nearly locked his joints in place. For armament, Cricket was issued a shotgun. His paws could barely grasp the weapon's grip. Still, he was better off than Orchid, who set out utterly unarmed wearing only an armored cloak and a rebreather.<br><br>The lower hatch of the ship wheezed open into the dim, sprawling hangar. Their ship was not alone. Dozens of other vessels rested still and silent on the deck. Cricket couldn't identify any of them, but he doubted any two ships were made by the same species. There were cubic warships, shiny yachts, and a fierce-looking fighter. One was a dried out carcass of a bioship. Many more were junk freighters jury-rigged together from old cannibalized hulks. <br><br>Cricket approached a cluster of white tanks near the far wall and checked their rusted dials. “I found something.”<br><br>“Something good, I hope,” Orchid said as she approached with the marine. “This is a fascinating museum of ships, but I doubt any of them will take us back to civilization.”<br><br>“It is good news. These must be fuel tanks. There is no telling what kind without testing, but still, fuel. At the very least, this will get the backup generators running.”<br><br>Lyleman laughed. “That's the first nice thing you've said since the crash. Maybe you're worth eating after all.”<br><br>“It is odd,” the bug-man said, tapping at a nozzle. “These tanks have never been used. They are completely sealed.”<br><br>“Either way, I've found an exit.” The private pointed the barrel of his gun toward an opening in the wall. “We need to secure the area before we siphon any fuel. Hopefully we can salvage more parts while we're at it.”<br><br>“And food. Maybe we can find food.” Cricket started toward the door.<br><br>“Hold up,” the marine said. “We don't want you getting killed out here. The guy with the gun heads in first.”<br><br>The halls were dark and twisted, cluttered with the kinds of unsettling gadgets and curiosities one would expect on a ship made of bones: jagged screws, unplugged androids and eldritch puzzle cubes. Cricket could feel the cold in the halls sapping his energy as he dragged all six legs across the floor.<br><br>He turned a corner and a shadow bolted out of his vision. The bug-man swung his shotgun up, squeezed his fingers into the trigger guard and fired. When the smoke cleared, there was nothing there but a missing chunk of wall.<br><br>“Christ, Cricket, are you alright?” Lyleman's shout mingled with the echoes of the gunshot.<br><br>“A mistake. It was just a shadow. I apologize.”<br><br>“Just keep alert and let me take the lead. Damn. Don't shoot until you know what you're going to hit.”<br><br>Orchid tugged at the bug-man's vest. “I'm scared, Cricket.”<br><br>“Perhaps you should have stayed at the ship,” Cricket said.<br><br>The halls ahead were soaked in a dim aquamarine glow. The marine led them through a maze of rooms, following the intensifying oceanic gleam until they arrived at a large spherical room the size of a dropship.  At the center of the sphere, the blue-green light flowed from a floating ball of plasma like water from a fountain.<br><br>“This must be the heart of the bone ship,” Orchid said.<br><br>“It certainly feels like it.” Lyleman checked his corners and walked softly toward the orb. He examined it, finding no imperfections on its smooth, effulgent surface. Taking a deep breath, the marine poked at the plasma with the barrel of his gun. <br><br>The orb exploded. Spirals of holographic dust and stars plastered the room. One by one, the stars began to brighten into shining flecks of gold until the room was full of light. Cricket stared at the starscape and edged closer to the brightest of the simulated suns.<br><br>“I know what this is,” Lyleman whispered. He slung his rifle over his shoulder and waved his hand through an intangible star. “The galaxy, the universe, everything. This is how it began.”<br><br>Cosmic dust compressed into planets and planetoids around the celestial lamps. When the hologram zoomed out, stars and planets clustered into small splotches like puddles of milk. Thousands of star systems and galaxies formed strange constellations throughout the heart of the bone ship.<br><br>“Wait a second...” the marine said. “I don't recognize any of these galaxies.”<br><br>The stars in the simulation blinked in and out of existence as they danced in their orbits. When entropy set in, Cricket realized he was watching the universe's life-cycle on fast-forward. Dark splotches speckled the hologram, headstones of dead solar systems. Some suns would not give in so easily. Dying stars devoured planets, moons, and even other suns in a desperate effort to stay alive. The stars that feasted lived for a moment longer, burning with the intensity of Roman candles before fizzling out into oblivion. When the entire hologram faded to black, the simulated universe crunched back into a ball and, after a moment or two, the plasma blasted apart into a fresh incarnation of the universe. The stars shone brighter here, the galaxies more numerous and complex.<br><br>Cricket watched the hologram cycle over and over again as the reconstructed universes were born. The stars and galaxies looked very much like insects in a hive to the bug-man. Many stars ate for the survival of the hive, while others gave their lives in the same cause. Hives, too, could grow, consuming lesser communities to reforge themselves into a greater network, one of unparalleled strength. It was an inspiring scene. The light show culminated in the creation of a more familiar universe. The Milky Way glistened in the center of the room.<br><br>“I've been waiting for this for so long,” Lyleman said, the aquamarine glow of the hologram glinting in his eyes. “I never thought I would find it. Something that would make it worthwhile. This is why I signed on to flight service. The money was good, but there are better ways to strike it rich. You can't find something like this in an asteroid mine. A moment of awe. The birth of a universe.”<br><br>“It's so beautiful,” Orchid said. “Like petals shaping into sculpture in the chaos of a summer wind.”<br><br>A doorway framed with pink laser beams appeared in the hologram. A dark hallway loomed beyond. A voice in Cricket's head buzzed, “Come and see.” With a shudder, the bug-man realized the disembodied voice spoke to him in his own insectoid language.<br><br>Orchid stared into the emptiness beyond the door. “I don't know what to do,” she said.<br><br>Private Lyleman knew exactly what to do. “It's calling me. Me. I can’t stop now.” He dropped his rifle to the floor and marched through the portal, vanishing in the dark.<br><br>Cricket got the feeling he just witnessed something important, but it was hard to tell.<br><br>“What do we do?” Orchid said, looking into the laser-light door frame.<br><br>The light dimmed, and Cricket and Orchid stood in the chamber alone with the shadows. He watched her brittle, browning leaves flutter as the plant woman tried to comprehend the vision. Cricket's mandibles clacked together as he watched her, and his stomach growled. No one wanted to eat the bug-man, but the bug-man wasn't so picky.<br><br>
